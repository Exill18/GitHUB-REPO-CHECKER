# GitHUB-Repo Checker
This project idea was taken from the the repository app-ideas by @florinpop17 (https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas).



This project was originally made to check if github was UP or DOWN. After I finished the project, I had another idea and decided to change the project to a program that you can insert a username
and check when was their last commit and the link to their profile. Also I add the function to click on the repo, and that repo is automatically clonned to the same folder you have this program.
